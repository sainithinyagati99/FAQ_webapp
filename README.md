This is a personal project for demonstrating the C# and .NET skills.
This Repo includes a project utilizing ASP.NET CORE, and MVC to create the basic web application, for viewing the most asked questions and a way to create, edit and delete those entries. This project integrates the use of User Authentication for performing any of the listed operations, meaning that the user has to be logged in to perform any operations as mentioned, else user is prompted to create a profile before performing any operations.

Feel free to use the code:)
